2-Input the three sides of the triangle as (a), (b), and (c)
3-If ((a + b > c) ) and ((a + c > b) ) and ((b + c > a)) then
4-If ( (a == b) ) and ( (b == c) ), then
Output “Equilateral triangle.”
5-Else if ((a == b) ) or ( (b == c) ) or ( (a == c) ), then
Output “Isosceles triangle.”
6-Else
Output “Scalene triangle.”
7-Else
Output “The sides cannot form a triangle.”
